# Quantexa Flight Assignment
This assignment from Quantexa involves the analysis of two CSV files (flightData.csv and passengers.csv).

The first file, flightData.csv includes 100,000 records with flight details about:
- 15,500 passengers
- 1000 flights
- 27 countries travelled to and from
- 342 dates (ranging from January 1st 2017 to December 31st 2017)

The second file, passengers.csv includes 15,500 passengers with
- first name
- last name

Most of the analysis for the purposes of this assignment have been completed on the first CSV (flightData.csv).

Using the above data, I have been asked to answer the following 4 questions which required calculating some statistics from the data

1. Find the total number of flights for each month.
2. Find the names of the 100 most frequent flyers.
3. Find the greatest number of countries a passenger has been in without being in the UK. For example, if the countries a passenger was in were: UK -> FR -> US -> CN -> UK -> DE -> UK, the correct answer would be 3 countries.
4. Find the passengers who have been on more than 3 flights together.
- Bonus Question: Find the passengers who have been on more than N flights together within the range (from,to).
